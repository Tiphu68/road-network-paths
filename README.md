## Mission Planning  - Shortest Path in a Road Network

Shortest road network paths with Open Street Map using a Dijkstra/A* Combo Algorithm

Finds a shortest path in a road network graph.

This shortest path algorithm combines Dijkstra's and A* algorithms into one function. The type is selectable and Dijkstras is treated as a special case of A* 

The heuristic function can easily be modified to accomplish distance related variants.

An example shows a detour attempt to bypass the shortest path.
